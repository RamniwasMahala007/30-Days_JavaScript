# 16 - CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect

![]()

view demo [here](https://ramniwasmahala007.github.io/30-Days_JavaScript/16-Mouse_Move_Shadow/)

## what did I learn ?

- `contenteditable`:-- You can edit the content by writing it at the beginning of the html tag.

- `text-shadow`:--I learned something about the new css property text-shadow.
                Each shadow is described by some combination of X and Y offsets from the element,
                blur radius, and color.


                '''
                /* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | color */
                text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black;
                 '''
